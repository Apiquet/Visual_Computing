This repository was made to create a game using Processing software.

In this game, the player has to move a ball on a plate to kick an adversary. This plate can be moved through the mouse or thanks to its camera. The second feature's implementation was an interesting image processing project.

To run it you need to have Processing installed, then, go to the Game folder and run Game.pde file
