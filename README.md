This repository was made to create a game using Processing software.

In this game, the player has to move a ball on a plate to kick an adversary. This plate can be moved through the mouse or thanks to its camera. The second feature's implementation was an interesting image processing project:

Implementation from scratch of:
- Blob detection algorithm
- Line detection with Hough Transform
- Line selection and quad estimation to find rectangle corners
- Pose estimation of the board (angles to move the ball)

To run it you need to have Processing installed, then, go to the Game folder and run Game.pde file
